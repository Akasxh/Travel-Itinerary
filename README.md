## Introduction

This Travel Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences and past travel history. It combines a machine learning model for generating recommendations with a Node.js backend for serving the API and managing user data.

## Machine Learning Model

Our machine learning model uses a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to generate travel recommendations.

### Data Preprocessing

1. User data is one-hot encoded for categorical features (e.g., preferred vibes, activities).
2. Numerical features (e.g., budget) are normalized using StandardScaler.
3. Past travel history is encoded as a sparse matrix of user-destination interactions.

### Model Architecture

We use a hybrid model combining:

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: A matrix factorization approach to learn latent factors for users and destinations.
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: A neural network that processes user preferences and destination features.

The final recommendation is a weighted combination of these two approaches.

### Training Process

1. The model is trained on historical user data, including past trips and preferences.
2. We use a custom loss function that combines rating prediction error and destination similarity.
3. The model is regularly retrained on new data to keep recommendations fresh and relevant.

### Generating Recommendations

1. For a given user, we feed their preferences and past history into the model.
2. The model outputs a ranked list of recommended destinations.
3. We then use a separate model to generate activity recommendations for the chosen destination.

## Node.js Backend

Our backend is built with Node.js and Express, providing a RESTful API for the frontend to consume.

### Key Components

1. **Express Server**: Handles HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate handlers.
2. **AWS SDK**: Integrates with AWS services for data storage and retrieval.
3. **Itinerary Generation**: Interfaces with the ML model to generate personalized itineraries.
4. **User Management**: Handles user data storage and retrieval.

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/itinerary`: Generates a new itinerary based on user preferences.
- `GET /api/user/:userId/trips`: Retrieves past trips for a specific user.

### Data Flow

1. The frontend sends a request with user preferences.
2. The backend retrieves the user's past trips from the database.
3. This data is passed to the ML model to generate recommendations.
4. The generated itinerary is saved to the database and returned to the user.

## Deployment and Scaling

While we don't currently have direct access to AWS RDS or Elastic Beanstalk, here's how we can deploy and scale the application:

### Database (AWS RDS)

1. **Setup**: Create an RDS instance with PostgreSQL engine.
2. **Connection**: Use the provided endpoint to connect from our application.
3. **Scaling**: 
   - Vertical scaling: Increase instance size for better performance.
   - Read replicas: Add read replicas to distribute read operations.

### Application Deployment (AWS Elastic Beanstalk)

1. **Setup**: Create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment for Node.js applications.
2. **Deployment**: 
   - Package the application as a ZIP file.
   - Upload the ZIP file to Elastic Beanstalk via the AWS Console or CLI.
3. **Scaling**:
   - Auto Scaling: Configure auto-scaling rules based on CPU utilization or network I/O.
   - Load Balancing: Elastic Beanstalk automatically sets up a load balancer for distribution of traffic.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

1. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline or a third-party service like Jenkins.
2. Configure the pipeline to automatically deploy to Elastic Beanstalk when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement user authentication and authorization.
2. Add more sophisticated error handling and input validation.
3. Introduce caching mechanisms to improve API response times.
4. Implement A/B testing for different recommendation algorithms.
5. Integrate with external APIs for real-time travel data (e.g., flight prices, weather).
